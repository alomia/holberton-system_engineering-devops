Distributed web infrastructure
I explain some details of this infrastructure:
        -For every additional element, why you are adding it:
                
                Firewall: security to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

                SSL certificate: security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser. 

                Monitoring clients: check the status and health of the servers you use to access virtual machines and containers.

        -What are firewalls for:
                A Firewall is a Security Product, whose main function is to filter out unauthorized and malicious
                traffic and they run between trusted and untrusted networks i.e private networks and the intern
                
        -Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
                https is more secure. Since https uses the secure port 443, which encrypts outgoing data,
                it is much more difficult for people to spy on your site.

        -What monitoring is used for:
                The monitoring software will monitor the computer's metrics, record them and issue an alert if
		anything unusual occurs or that may cause the computer to malfunction.

        -How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
                
        -Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:

I explain the problems of this infrastructure:
        - Where are SPOF
                Refers to one fault or malfunction that can cause an entire system to stop operating.

                This type of infrastructure does not have a firewall to filter malicious requests or malwares.

        Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
                
        No monitoring
                There is no monitoring tool such as application or server monitoring, i.e. there are no statistics on how the resources
                of each server are being managed and functioning.
