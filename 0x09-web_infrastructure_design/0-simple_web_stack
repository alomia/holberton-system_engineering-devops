Simple web stack:
I explain some details of this infrastructure:
        - What is a server:
                A server is a computer that is integrated into a computer network where other machines,
                computers or clients are located and that is fed with all kinds of information to store it and then
                distribute it. In addition, they are never shut down, are always operational to offer the best
                services and are programmed to be tolerant to not very serious failures.

        - What is the role of the domain name:
                It is a unique name that represents a website or web application on the Internet.

        - What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com:
                CNAME: can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname.

       - What is the role of the web server:
                It is a computer that stores the files that make up a website
                (e.g. HTML documents, images, CSS style sheets and JavaScript file)
                and delivers them to the end user's device. It is connected to the Internet
                and is accessible through a domain name.

        - What is the role of the application server:
                A type of server designed to install, operate and host applications and associated services for end users.
        
        - What is the role of the database:
                The database stores the data to be supplied to the application upon request.

        - What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website:
                It uses a web protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

                The HTTP protocol is the protocol that allows the exchange of hypertext information (links) of web pages.

I explain the problems of this infrastructure:

        - SPOF:
                refers to one fault or malfunction that can cause an entire system to stop operating.

        - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)

        - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
